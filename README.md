# OSSU-CS
Summary
The OSSU curriculum is a complete education in computer science using online materials. It's not merely for career training or professional development. It's for those who want a proper, well-rounded grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own, but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners.

It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements, as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS. The courses themselves are among the very best in the world, often coming from Harvard, Princeton, MIT, etc., but specifically chosen to meet the following criteria.

Courses must:

Be open for enrollment
Run regularly (ideally in self-paced format, otherwise running multiple times per year)
Be of generally high quality in teaching materials and pedagogical principles
Match the curricular standards of the CS 2013: Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Computer Science
When no course meets the above criteria, the coursework is supplemented with a book. When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality, they belong in extras/courses or extras/readings.

Organization. The curriculum is designed as follows:

Intro CS: for students to try out CS and see if it's right for them
Core CS: corresponds roughly to the first three years of a computer science curriculum, taking classes that all majors would be required to take
Advanced CS: corresponds roughly to the final year of a computer science curriculum, taking electives according to the student's interests
Final Project: a project for students to validate, consolidate, and display their knowledge, to be evaluated by their peers worldwide
Duration. It is possible to finish within about 2 years if you plan carefully and devote roughly 20 hours/week to your studies. Learners can use this spread to estimate their end date. Make a copy and input your start date and expected hours per week in the Timeline sheet. As you work through courses you can enter your actual course completion dates in the Curriculum Data sheet and get updated completion estimates.

Cost. All or nearly all course material is available for free. However, some courses may charge money for assignments/tests/projects to be graded. Note that both Coursera and edX offer financial aid.

Decide how much or how little to spend based on your own time and budget; just remember that you can't purchase success!

Process. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

We recommend doing all courses in Core CS, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core CS) in order from top to bottom, as they have already been topologically sorted by their prerequisites.
Courses in Advanced CS are electives. Choose one subject (e.g. Advanced programming) you want to become an expert in and take all the courses under that heading. You can also create your own custom subject, but we recommend getting validation from the community on the subject you choose.
Content policy. If you plan on showing off some of your coursework publicly, you must share only files that you are allowed to. Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct that you signed in the beginning of each course!

Final project
OSS University is project-focused. The assignments and exams for each course are to prepare you to use your knowledge to solve real-world problems.

After you've gotten through all of Core CS and the parts of Advanced CS relevant to you, you should think about a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired. Not only does real project work look great on a resume, but the project will also validate and consolidate your knowledge. You can create something entirely new, or you can find an existing project that needs help via websites like CodeTriage or First Timers Only.

Students who would like more guidance in creating a project may choose to use a series of project oriented courses. Here is a sample of options (many more are available, at this point you should be capable of identifying a series that is interesting and relevant to you):

Courses	Duration	Effort	Prerequisites
Fullstack Open	12 weeks	6 hours/week	programming
Modern Robotics (Specialization)	26 weeks	2-5 hours/week	freshman-level physics, linear algebra, calculus, linear ordinary differential equations
Data Mining (Specialization)	30 weeks	2-5 hours/week	machine learning
Big Data (Specialization)	30 weeks	3-5 hours/week	none
Internet of Things (Specialization)	30 weeks	1-5 hours/week	strong programming
Cloud Computing (Specialization)	30 weeks	2-6 hours/week	C++ programming
Data Science (Specialization)	43 weeks	1-6 hours/week	none
Functional Programming in Scala (Specialization)	29 weeks	4-5 hours/week	One year programming experience
Game Design and Development with Unity 2020 (Specialization)	6 months	5 hours/week	programming, interactive design
Evaluation
Upon completing your final project:

Submit your project's information to PROJECTS via a pull request.

Put the OSSU-CS badge in the README of your repository! Open Source Society University - Computer Science

Markdown: [![Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://img.shields.io/badge/OSSU-computer--science-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)

Use our community channels to announce it to your fellow students.

Solicit feedback from your OSSU peers. You will not be "graded" in the traditional sense — everyone has their own measurements for what they consider a success. The purpose of the evaluation is to act as your first announcement to the world that you are a computer scientist and to get experience listening to feedback — both positive and negative.

The final project evaluation has a second purpose: to evaluate whether OSSU, through its community and curriculum, is successful in its mission to guide independent learners in obtaining a world-class computer science education.

Cooperative work
You can create this project alone or with other students! We love cooperative work! Use our channels to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects!

Which programming languages should I use?
My friend, here is the best part of liberty! You can use any language that you want to complete the final project.

The important thing is to internalize the core concepts and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.

Congratulations
After completing the requirements of the curriculum above, you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Congratulations!

What is next for you? The possibilities are boundless and overlapping:

Look for a job as a developer!
Check out the readings for classic books you can read that will sharpen your skills and expand your knowledge.
Join a local developer meetup (e.g. via meetup.com).
Pay attention to emerging technologies in the world of software development:
Explore the actor model through Elixir, a new functional programming language for the web based on the battle-tested Erlang Virtual Machine!
Explore borrowing and lifetimes through Rust, a systems language which achieves memory- and thread-safety without a garbage collector!
Explore dependent type systems through Idris, a new Haskell-inspired language with unprecedented support for type-driven development.
keep learning

How to show your progress
Create an account in Trello.
Copy this board to your personal account. See how to copy a board here.
Now that you have a copy of our official board, you just need to pass the cards to the Doing column or Done column as you progress in your study.

We also have labels to help you have more control through the process. The meaning of each of these labels is:

Main Curriculum: cards with that label represent courses that are listed in our curriculum.
Extra Resources: cards with that label represent courses that were added by the student.
Doing: cards with that label represent courses the student is current doing.
Done: cards with that label represent courses finished by the student. Those cards should also have the link for at least one project/article built with the knowledge acquired in such course.
Section: cards with that label represent the section that we have in our curriculum. Those cards with the Section label are only to help the organization of the Done column. You should put the Course's cards below its respective Section's card.
The intention of this board is to provide our students a way to track their progress, and also the ability to show their progress through a public page for friends, family, employers, etc. You can change the status of your board to be public or private.
